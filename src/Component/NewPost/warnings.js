  'Again? Have you heard the saying ‘If you’ve got nothing nice to say then don’t say anything at all’? This is your second warning and you only get 3 chances before you’re out! Time to take it seriously - that’s not allowed on DiGii - we build each other up on this site. Check the box to agree to agree and return to the Message Board.',
  'That’s it - you’re out of the system! There are so many ways to talk to people - even the ones you don’t like without using a put down. You’ve lost 10 DiGii-T’s and you’ll need to watch the ‘Put down free zone’ tutorial before you can get back online.'
